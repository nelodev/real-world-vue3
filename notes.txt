- Client Side Routing (CSR)

> Renders differences without reloading the page
> Modern app (Single Page Application - SPA) -> We are really just looking at one page, index.html. When we interact, we just adjust which view are we seeing of that app

- Server Side Routing (SSR)

> Browser refreshes on every page load
> Traditional app -> Fetching content from different urls
    - example-url.com/
    - example-url.com/dashboard
